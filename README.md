This is my personal copy of my modified configuration files for Marlin Firmware.  These files are from Marlin-1.0.1 version of the firmware.

This repository currently contains:
Configuration.h
Configuration_adv.h
dogm_lcd_implementation.h

The Config* files contain settings that are specific to my printer and include the values that I have chosen to use.

The dogm... file contains a bug fix.  I wasn't able to compile the firmware without integrating the bug fix.
This issue may be resolved in later versions of the arduino environment, but for now it seemed easier to save this change.
